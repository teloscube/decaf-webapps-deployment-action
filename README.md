# DECAF Web Apps Deployment Action

1. Builds a DECAF Web App based on `branch`, `tag` and `deployment path`.
2. Deploys the built app to the remote server.

## Required Secrets

Set the following secrets in your repository or organization settings:

- `DEPLOY_HOST`: The hostname of the remote server.
- `DEPLOY_USER`: The username of the remote server.
- `DEPLOY_KEY`: The private key of the remote server.

## Required Parameters

- `app_name`: The name of the app to build.
- `remote_host`: The hostname of the remote server.
- `remote_user`: The username of the remote server.
- `remote_key`: The private for the the remote server.

## Optional Parameters

- `sentry_org`: The Sentry organization to use for sourcemap uploading.
- `sentry_project`: The Sentry project to use for sourcemap uploading.
- `sentry_token`: The Sentry token to use for sourcemap uploading.
- `build_folder`: The folder to deploy. Default is `build`.

## Deployment Type Arguments

There are four types of deployment: `production`, `staging`, `preview` and `version`.

1. `production` and `staging` are both based on the `main` branch.
2. `version` is also based on the `main` branch but is deployed to a different path (e.g: `v.0.1.0`)
3. `preview` is also a boolean flag. When this is true, the deployment is deployed to a path that is like `preview-XXX` where `XXX` is the pull request number.

## Example Usage

```yml
name: Deploy

on:
  release:
    types: [created]
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Use Node.js ${{matrix.node-version}}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{matrix.node-version}}

      - name: "Build and Deploy"
        id: build
        uses: teloscube/decaf-webapps-deployment-action
        with:
          app_name: demo-app
          deployment_domain: "sandbox.dev.decafhub.com"
          production: true
          staging: true
          preview: true
          version: v0.1.0
          remote_host: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
          remote_user: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
          remote_key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
          sentry_org: teloscube
          sentry_project: demo-app
          sentry_token: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          build_folder: "build"
```

## Outputs

You can use the following outputs. The values are populated after the action is completed. Normally, you would not need to use these outputs.

- `urlpaths`: The URL paths of the deployed apps separated by `||`. (e.g `/webapps/xxx/production||/webapps/xxx/staging||/webapps/xxx/preview-42`)

Example usage of the output values (Assuming the id of the step is `build`):

```yml
${{ steps.build.outputs.urlpaths }}
```
